Trees created with the following R code:
Trees are named as "n<exponent>_bl<branch_length>.tre", where 2^exponent = number of taxa and bl = branch length.
```r
require(ape)
branch_lengths <- c( 0.0025, 0.01, 0.04, 0.16, 0.64 )
for (exp in 7:11){
    t <- stree(2^exp, type = "balanced")
    for (bl in branch_lengths){
        t <- compute.brlen(t, bl)
        name <- paste("n", exp, "_bl", bl, ".tre", sep="")
        write.tree(t, name)
    }
}
```
