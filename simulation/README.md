Trees from real data for simulation.

1. `camelid.tre`, `hivrt.tre`, and `vertrho.tre` are from Murrell et al. 2012, 2013. 
2. `amine.tre` is from Spielman et al. 2015
3. `h3n2_ha.tre` is from Meyer Wilke 2015 (PLoS Path)


Trees represent..
1. Vertebrate rhodopsin: small and high divergence
2. Camelid             : intermediate and high divergence
3. HIV RT              : intermediate and low divergence
4. H3N2_HA             : large and low divergence 
5. amine               : large and high divergence

Note that simulations for (4) and (5) will be analyzed only with FUBAR and SLAC for runtime considerations.
